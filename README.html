 Stock control system

 IMPORTANT: Even though some endpoints are not implemented until now (4 a.m. of 18/03/2024), the main focus was to showcase my code style, architecture, clean code, and extensive testing (unit tests and database integration tests). Other features are yet to be implemented.

 

 Context:

●         Some client (Let's call him Cris) deal with acquisition and  manufacturing of diverse kind of products and sell those products and need stock control for them:

●        A product can be composed of other products from its inventory or can be a component sold separately. No problems at all.

○        One of the requirements are:

■         if a product A uses (x amounts of the product b +Y amounts of the product C), so, when the product A be constructed those x and y amounts must be subtracted from the products B and C, respectivlym, but the current quantity of an entire produced computer will increase.

   

 Use cases:

●         The client is able to sell, separately  computer processors, motherboards, air coolers for computers, and all the related components of a computer

○        Each computer component mentioned above is a product in their stock, which registers the current quantity of this product in the inventory, along with information such as name, and others..

○        The client is also able to sell an entire desktop computer.build from the items (computer components mentioned above) he owns at this inventory

○        The client can already have x amounts of desktop computers produced by him  and ready to sell it with immediate delivery,, the stock control will show that x desktop computers can be sold immediately - no need to manufacture them.

 

●        If the client does not have any desktop computers already produced and ready to be sold, they can check if they have all the computer components needed to manufacture a new one and sell it.

○        The stock will provide information about how many computers can be produced with the current components available in their inventory.

■        The system registers what components are needed to produce the computer, as well as how much of each component is needed to produce it.

●        For example: to produce a computer, in addition to other components, you need 2 air coolers, 1 processor, and 1 motherboard.

○        The client is now able to know if/how many computers can be produced depending on the quantity of each necessary supply they have in their stock.

■         Example:

●        if they only needed 2 air coolers, 1 processor, and 1 motherboard to build up a computer and sell it, and

●         currently have 3 processors, 5 air coolers, and 6 motherboards (remembering: each one of them can be sold separately!), the system must provide information that only 2 computers can be produced with such an amount of supplies.

●        iF 1 COMPUTER BE CONSTRUCTED, WILL BE  REGISTER AS A PRODUCT IN THE DATABASE

○        SHOULD INCREMENT THE CURRENT AVAILABLE QUANTITY IN STOCK.OF THE COMPUTER

○        SHOULD DECREMENT THE USED COMPONENTS TO MANUFACTURE THE COMPUTER

 

■        eVEN THE COMPUTER - A PRODUCT WICH NEEDS CERTAIN AMOUNTS OF DIFFERENT COMPONENTS - COULD BE A COMPONENT OF ANOTHER PRODUCT, LIKE ONE WICH COMES ALONG WITH KEYBOARD AND LEDS.
